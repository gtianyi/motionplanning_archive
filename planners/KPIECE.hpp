/**
   @anchor cKPIECELocal
   @par Short description
   KPIECE is a tree-based planner that uses a discretization
   (multiple levels, in general) to guide the exploration of
   the continuous space. This implementation is a simplified
   one, using a single level of discretization: one grid. The
   grid is imposed on a projection of the state space. When
   exploring the space, preference is given to the boundary of
   this grid. The boundary is computed to be the set of grid
   cells that have less than 2n non-diagonal neighbors in an
   n-dimensional projection space.
   It is important to set the projection the algorithm uses
   (setProjectionEvaluator() function). If no projection is
   set, the planner will attempt to use the default projection
   associated to the state space. An exception is thrown if
   no default projection is available either.
   This implementation is intended for systems with differential constraints.
